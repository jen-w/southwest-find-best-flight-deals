Script to scrape data from https://www.southwest.com/find-best-flight-deals/?originMarket=OAK and SFO and SJC

I just got the companion pass!!!! I load the resulting tsv into Excel and use the data to help inform where I can go next for the low low.

I don't know Southwest's rhyme or reason for featuring the flights they do on this page, but the copy says "Find the Best Flight Deals with Southwest Airlines". In my experience clicking around, the featured flight's date is a good month approximation for when a low flight price can be found.
